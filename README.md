# job_descriptions_analysis_through_nlp
Text analysis of job descriptions with NERC and regular expressions

Using Natural Language Processing two techniques, Regular Expressions and Named Entity Recognition were used in order to give an insight in the number of vacancies and most requested skills in the United States of America. The dataset from the kaggle competition “US jobs on Monster.com” has been used as input. The new insights obtained could help job seekers to find a job. It is visualized through a word cloud and bar chart.
